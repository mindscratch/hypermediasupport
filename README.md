Hypermedia Support
==================

[REST is OVER](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-02-23-rest-is-over), "Hypermedia API" is the new hotness. Well, maybe not "new" but it's the type of API you should be aiming to build, forget the REST. (like that pun?)

I've been trying to evolve my "REST" API's to adhere to more of the constraints outlined in Roy Fielding's [dissertation](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). As I've been evolving, I've found myself repeating code especially when doing CRUD related activities.

Please fork, improve and add more goodness. I'll gladly accept pull requests, especially those that are written well and have spec's.

## Let's get our HATEOAS on!!!
